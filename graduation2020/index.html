    <h1 class="title">Congrats on graduating!</h1>
    <p>
        As you all know, schools are closing due to the corona virus outbreak. For us seniors, that means that
        commencement would most likely be canceled as well. For a lot of us,
        commencement is a ceremony to celebrate with family for all the hard work we've put in for the past however many
        years in college. I made this virtual ceremony inspired by all the Zoom ceremony memes for all the Spring
        2020 graduates. Hope this will put a smile on you during these hard times. Stay safe, keep washing your hands,
        and stop hoarding toilet paper. Enjoy! <br><br>
